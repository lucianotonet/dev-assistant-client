# Issue 10: Invalid Mode Error in update_file Function

## Description

When trying to update a file using the update_file function in the files module, an 'Invalid mode' error is returned. This error occurs regardless of the mode passed to the function, including common modes like 'write' and 'append'.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Call the update_file function with a valid file path and content, and a mode of 'write' or 'append'.
2. The function returns an 'Invalid mode' error.

## Expected Behavior

The function should update the file with the provided content. If the mode is 'write', the function should overwrite the existing content of the file. If the mode is 'append', the function should add the new content to the end of the file.

## Actual Behavior

The function returns an 'Invalid mode' error, regardless of the mode passed to the function.

## Possible Solution

Check the implementation of the update_file function in the files module. Make sure the function is set up to handle 'write' and 'append' modes. If it's not, you will need to add this functionality.

Also, consider adding some logging or print statements in the update_file function to help debug the issue. This could give you a better idea of where exactly the problem is occurring.
